# Wrike - A Todo Application made on React JS

Wrike is a beautiful Todo application developed using React JS. It utilizes antd and Material UI libraries to provide a visually appealing user interface. The application is designed to help you manage your tasks in an efficient manner.

## About Me

My name is Eeshaan Sethia, and I am a second-year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am the sole developer of this project and have experience working with React JS, Node JS, and MongoDB.

## Motivation

The motivation behind building Wrike was to create a simple and efficient Todo application that allows users to manage their tasks in a seamless manner. I noticed that many existing Todo applications were either too complicated or lacked important features, so I set out to build an application that is easy to use and has all the essential features.

## Features

Wrike has the following features:

1. **Adding Tasks** - You can add a new task by entering the Task Name, Description and Deadline.

2. **Editing Tasks** - You can edit an existing task by clicking on the Edit icon.

3. **Removing Tasks** - You can remove a task by clicking on the Delete icon.

4. **Completing Tasks** - You can mark a task as completed by clicking on the checkbox.

5. **Sorting Tasks** - You can sort the tasks according to the Deadline and whether they are completed or not.

6. **Pagination** - You can navigate through the pages of the task list using the pagination at the bottom of the page.

7. **Local Storage** - Wrike stores all task data in the user's local storage, so the user can access their tasks even after closing the application.

## Technologies Used

Wrike is built using React JS, antd, and Material UI libraries. The application is designed to run in any modern web browser, and there are no special requirements for users who want to run the application on their local machines.

## Running the Application Locally

To run Wrike locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/eeshaansethia/multipage-to-do`

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project using the command `cd Wrike`.

3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

4. Start the development server using the command `npm start`.

5. The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.
